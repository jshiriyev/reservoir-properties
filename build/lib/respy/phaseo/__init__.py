PROPERTIES OF CRUDE OIL SYSTEMS

Petroleum (an equivalent term is crude oil) is a complex mixture consisting
predominantly of hydrocarbons and containing sulfur, nitrogen,
oxygen, and helium as minor constituents. The physical and chemical
properties of crude oils vary considerably and are dependent on the
centration of the various types of hydrocarbons and minor constituents
present.

An accurate description of physical properties of crude oils is of a
considerable importance in the fields of both applied and theoretical science
and especially in the solution of petroleum reservoir engineering problems.
Physical properties of primary interest in petroleum engineering
studies include:

• Fluid gravity
• Specific gravity of the solution gas
• Gas solubility
• Bubble-point pressure
• Oil formation volume factor
• Isothermal compressibility coefficient of undersaturated crude oils
• Oil density
• Total formation volume factor
• Crude oil viscosity
• Surface tension

Data on most of these fluid properties are usually determined by laboratory
experiments performed on samples of actual reservoir fluids. In
the absence of experimentally measured properties of crude oils, it is
necessary for the petroleum engineer to determine the properties from
empirically derived correlations.
